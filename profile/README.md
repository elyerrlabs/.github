**Elyerr Labs** builds modular tools for the Laravel ecosystem, focused on clean architecture, scalability, and real-world backend systems.

## 🎯 Mission

Build well-structured Laravel packages that help developers create scalable systems without unnecessary complexity.

We believe in:

- Modularity over monoliths  
- Explicit architecture over hidden magic  
- Solving real problems, not demos

## 🧩 What We Build

- Modular Laravel packages  
- OAuth2 / Passport-based authorization systems

Packages are designed to work standalone or as part of larger modular systems.
